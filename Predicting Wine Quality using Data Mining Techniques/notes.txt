@agencies working with the data
--
Still some reserach is going on identifying wines through all the informations of wines. This is an initiative of the research. 
--
intented use of the data
--
Students around the world are using this dataset for sentiment analysis. And using this dataset leads to creation of application on choosing the top quality wines by filtering attributes. With this dataset we can able to find the supporting attributes on choosing the top quality wine. 
--
attribute types of the data
--
There are totally 10 attributes and 27001 instances. Let me list out the attributes name and some infomation on the attributes. 
1.Country: This attribute defines in which country the wine is from. Totally there are 17 distinct countries.

trainingset
The algorithm was run with 10-fold cross-validation.
the model achieved a result of 24291/24291 correct or 100%.
There are no errors in the confusion matrix.

testingset
The algorithm was run with 10-fold cross-validation.
the model achieved a result of 2698/2698 correct or 99.9629%.
There is one error where one of the normal wine are classified as top quality wine. 
mean absolute error is 0.0003
